# IMAGE BACKGROUND REMOVER â€“ FRONT-END PROJECT
Project Overview:
This project is a user-friendly web application that allows users to upload an image from their device and automatically removes its background using the remove.bg AI API. The web app is built entirely with frontend technologies and delivers a seamless, professional experience through a combination of modern UI, responsive design, and interactive features. 

Key Features:
1. Image Upload & Preview: Users can upload image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) from their local system and immediately see a preview before processing.
2. One-Click Background Removal: Upon clicking the "Remove Background" button, the app sends the uploaded image to the remove.bg REST API, which processes and returns a new image with the background removed using advanced AI segmentation.
3. Loader Animation: A loading spinner is shown while the API processes the image, improving UX and feedback.
4. Result Display & Download: The processed image (with no background) is displayed on the screen, along with a "Download" button that allows users to save the image instantly.
5. Dark Mode Toggle: A stylish toggle button allows users to switch between light and dark themes dynamically, enhancing accessibility and user preference.
6. Responsive & Interactive UI: Designed to work smoothly across desktops and mobile devices with clean layout, intuitive buttons, and modular styling.
